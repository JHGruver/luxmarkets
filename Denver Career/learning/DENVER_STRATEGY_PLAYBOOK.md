Hi [Austin Contact],

I hope you've been well! The markets at [Property] have been fantastic,
and we've received great feedback from your residents.

I'm reaching out because Lux Markets is expanding to Denver, and I'm
leading the market development there. I'd love to connect with your
counterparts in the Denver region.

Would you be willing to make an introduction to [Denver Regional Manager]

Thanks so much,
Jacob

### Vendor Sourcing Channels

### Vendor Pitch Framework

**The WIIFM (What's In It For Me):**

1. **Access** - "You get in front of 200+ high-income residents who are specifically looking to discover new products"

2. **Efficiency** - "No booth fee, no weather worries, indoor setup, and we handle all the logistics"

3. **Quality** - "We curate only 8-12 vendors per market, so you're not competing with 50+ booths"

4. **Experience** - "The environment elevates your brand - it's a premium setting, not a parking lot"

5. **Data** - "We share resident feedback and help you understand what resonates"

### Cold Email Script

```
Subject: Unique Resident Experience Opportunity - Lux Markets

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Property Name] has beautiful amenity spaces that would
be perfect for the kind of curated experiences we create at Lux Markets.

We partner with luxury residential communities to host pop-up markets
featuring handpicked local brands - think artisan foods, craft beverages,
wellness products, and more. Everything is turnkey: we handle vendor
curation, setup, and execution.

In Austin, we work with communities like [AMLI/Greystar properties],
and we're now expanding to Denver. Our property partners see this as
a valuable amenity that differentiates their community and creates
memorable resident experiences.

Would you be open to a brief call to explore if this could work for
[Property Name]?

Best,
Jacob Gruver

```

### Phone Call Script

```
"Hi, I'm trying to reach [Name], the community manager.
Is he/she available?

[If available:]

Hi [Name], this is Jacob with Lux Markets. We help luxury apartment
communities create unique resident experiences through curated pop-up
markets. I sent an email earlier this week - did you have a chance
to see it?

[Listen, then:]

I'd love to tell you more about what we do. We bring handpicked
local vendors - artisan food brands, craft beverages, wellness
products - directly into your amenity spaces for a few hours.
Everything is turnkey for you.

We've done this with 25+ properties in Austin, including AMLI and
Greystar communities, and residents love it. Would you have 15 minutes
this week to learn more?

[Schedule meeting or handle objection]

## Objection Handling

### Property Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We don't have budget for this" | "There's actually no cost to you. We handle everything and work with the vendors on fees. Your only investment is the space for a few hours." |
| "Our residents aren't interested" | "That's what many properties think until they try it. We consistently see 30-40% resident attendance. Would you be open to a pilot event to test interest?" |
| "We already do resident events" | "That's great - this would complement your existing programming, not replace it. It's a completely different experience that adds variety. Many of our best partners have robust event calendars." |
| "I need to check with corporate" | "Absolutely understand. Would it help if I provided a one-pager you could share? Also, we work with [AMLI/Greystar] in Austin - your colleagues there could speak to the experience." |
| "We're too busy right now" | "I completely understand. When would be a better time to revisit? I'd love to at least stay in touch so this is on your radar when timing is right." |

### Vendor Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I already do farmers markets" | "This is a completely different experience. You're not competing with 50 other vendors, the crowd is captive and affluent, and you're indoors with a premium setup. Many of our vendors do both and see Lux Markets as their highest-ROI channel." |
| "What's the fee?" | "We work on a revenue share model - [X%] of your sales. That means we're only successful when you're successful. No upfront booth fees." |
| "I can't commit to regular events" | "We're flexible. Some vendors do every market, others pick and choose based on their schedule. What would work for your business?" |
| "My products are too expensive" | "Our audience is specifically high-income residents in luxury communities. Premium pricing is actually what they expect. What's your price range?" |
