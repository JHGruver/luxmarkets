| **CPG** | Food, beverages, toiletries, cleaning products | Daily/Weekly | Days to months |
| **Durable Goods** | Appliances, furniture, electronics | Yearly+ | Years |
| **Soft Goods** | Clothing, shoes | Seasonal | Months to years |

### Why CPG Matters to Lux Markets

- **High repeat purchase rate** = recurring vendor relationships
- **Low barrier to trial** = residents willing to try new products
- **Emotional connection** = brands that resonate create loyal customers
- **Perfect for discovery** = markets are ideal for introducing new products

### The Disruption Happening Now

Traditional CPG giants are losing market share to:

1. **Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) brands** - Selling online, bypassing retail
2. **Local/artisan producers** - Authenticity and quality over scale
3. **Mission-driven brands** - Sustainability, health, social impact
4. **Private label** - Store brands improving quality

**This disruption creates the opportunity for Lux Markets** - emerging brands need alternative channels to reach consumers.
